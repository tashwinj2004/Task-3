# Task-3
I have prepared two dashboard pages. In the first, I used cards to represent total revenue and total orders to date, and incorporated KPIs to display monthly orders and revenue. A line chart shows the trend of revenue over time, with a month-year hierarchy, and a matrix presents the total number of orders and revenue generated by each product. A slicer allows filtering the data by country. In the second dashboard, I added a map visual to display total orders across regions, with a drill-down hierarchy and a country slicer to enable dynamic exploration of the data. These dashboards provide a comprehensive view of revenue and order metrics for detailed analysis.
